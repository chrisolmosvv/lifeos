# LifeOS — Handoff Log

> I am the message that lets the chats and Claude Code talk through you.
> LIVING doc. Newest entry on top. Keep entries short.

## How the relay works
You (the owner) are the messenger. Nobody reads this automatically except
Claude Code. To coordinate:

1. **Planner chat → Builder.** You discuss a phase in a chat here; it gives you
   a clear instruction. You paste that into Claude Code.
2. **Builder writes an entry here** describing what it did and how to verify.
3. **Builder → Checker chat.** You paste the latest entry (plus screenshots or
   the file it names) into a fresh "checker" chat here. Ask it to review.
4. **Checker → Builder.** The checker writes a short "fix list." You paste that
   back into Claude Code.

Tip: to give a chat here the current code, either paste the file, upload it, or
(if your GitHub repo is public) paste the raw file link and ask the chat to read it.

### 2026-06-22 — Phase 4 (Piece 4a) — Events spine table + bare-bones verify UI
WHAT CHANGED:
- **New `events` table in Supabase**, built to the FULL architecture shape so the
  4b timeline + future Apple-sync bolt on with no rebuild: title, notes, category,
  start_at / end_at (calendar-standard span), location, repeat_rule, the hidden
  external_id, created_at. SQL: `db/04_events.sql` (run it once — steps below).
  RLS ON, owner-only (the same four `auth.uid() = user_id` policies as tasks).
- **Category link is set-null-on-delete, NEVER cascade** — deleting a category
  empties its events' category (they fall to uncategorised) instead of deleting
  them. Mirrors the tasks rule exactly. Enforced in the DB.
- **Backwards-event guard in the DB** — a CHECK constraint (`end_at >= start_at`)
  means an event that ends before it starts can never be stored.
- **A calm Events (verify) section** lists events with their span + category
  dot+tag, adds one (title + start + end pickers + optional category), and
  deletes one. Reuses the paper/ink/Fraunces foundation + `CategoryTag`. This is
  a throwaway verify UI — the real events live on the Phase-4b timeline.
- NOT built: the timeline / hour grid, event blocks, the now-line, drag-to-
  schedule, recurrence logic, overlap handling, the week/day calendar split. The
  schema has the fields; the UI just proves save/read/delete.

WHERE I PUT THE VERIFY UI:
- Inside **Settings**, below the Categories manager (a temporary section behind a
  hairline). It's throwaway — it'll be removed when the real calendar lands.

FILES TOUCHED:
- New: `db/04_events.sql`, `src/EventsVerify.jsx`, `src/events.css`
- Edited: `src/Settings.jsx` (renders the verify section), `src/settings.css`
- NOT touched: `db/03_tasks.sql`, the categories SQL, any task/category code.

SUPABASE STEP (do this once, before verifying):
1. Open the SQL editor:
   https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/cntlptuacsujbdtwvbis/sql/new
2. Open `db/04_events.sql`, copy the WHOLE file, paste it in, click **Run**.
   You should see "Success. No rows returned." (It needs the earlier db/ files,
   which are already run.)

HOW TO VERIFY (on your Mac):
1. `npm run dev`, open http://localhost:5173, log in, go to **Settings**.
2. Scroll to **Events (verify)** (below Categories).
3. Type an event title, pick a **Start** and an **End** (end after start),
   optionally pick a category, click **Add event** → it appears in the list with
   its time span and its category dot+tag.
4. **Category-survives test:** give an event a category, then go up to the
   Categories manager and **delete that category**. Back in Events, the event is
   **still there**, now showing **Uncategorised** (NOT gone).
5. **Backwards-event test:** add an event with the **End before the Start** →
   it's **refused** with a plain message ("That event ends before it starts").
6. **Delete** an event with its Delete button → it disappears.
7. **Log out and back in** (Settings → Log out), reopen Settings → your events
   are still there. Confirms they persisted and are only yours.

KNOWN GAPS / RISKS:
- The verify UI is deliberately plain and parked in Settings — no timeline yet.
- Uncategorised events show a hollow "Uncategorised" dot/tag (events don't use the
  Inbox bucket — that's a tasks concept).
- Times are entered/shown in your local wall-clock; stored as proper UTC
  timestamps.

NEXT: Phase 4, Piece 4b — the day-column timeline (renders events + scheduled
tasks together; fills the Today "The Day" column for real).

FOR THE CHECKER (please confirm against `db/04_events.sql`):
- The `events` table is **owner-only**: RLS enabled, all four policies
  (select/insert/update/delete) keyed to `auth.uid() = user_id`; `user_id`
  defaults to `auth.uid()` so an owner can't be forged.
- `category_id` **references `public.categories(id)` with `ON DELETE SET NULL`**
  (NOT cascade) — matches the tasks table exactly; deleting a category empties its
  events, never deletes them.
- The **end-before-start guard** exists: CHECK `end_at >= start_at`.
- `external_id` is **present but unused** (nullable, shown in no UI).
- This **ADDS** the events table and does **NOT** change the tasks or categories
  tables or their meaning (no edits to their SQL or code).

### 2026-06-22 — The real Today home — Today / This Week task blocks (Front Page)
WHAT CHANGED (UI only — NO database or schema change):
- **Built the real Today screen** to the approved Front Page two-column shape,
  replacing the temporary task view that sat on the Today route.
- **Left "The Day" column** is a calm placeholder for now — events don't exist
  until Phase 4, so it shows a quiet invitation ("Your day's timeline arrives
  with events") and keeps the two-column shape. NO hour grid / event blocks yet.
- **Right side is real:** a **Today** block and a **This Week** block, each a
  Fraunces headline over a hairline-ruled list. **Today** lists tasks with
  time_bucket = Today; **This Week** lists time_bucket = This Week. (Someday tasks
  aren't shown here — by design.) Rows reuse everything from before: the dot+tag
  (`CategoryTag`), the calm priority treatment, and completed tasks shown
  struck-through with the filled terracotta tick.
- **All the task behaviours carried over:** each block has a quiet "+ Add a task"
  (a task added in the Today block lands in Today; in This Week, lands in This
  Week); tap a task to open the Piece-2a edit panel (title/notes/category/
  priority); tick to complete / reopen.
- **Retired the redundant standalone task view** (`Tasks.jsx` deleted) now that
  Today covers it; its row styles live on (TaskRow now owns the `tasks.css`
  import).
- Desktop **zero-scroll:** the page itself doesn't scroll; only the right column
  scrolls, and only if the two blocks together run long.

NOTE: the mock file `mockups/lifeos-today-frontpage.html` was again NOT in the
repo, so this was built from your written description + 06-design.md. Compare to
your mock and I'll adjust spacing/type.

FILES TOUCHED:
- New: `src/Today.jsx`, `src/TaskBlock.jsx`, `src/today.css`
- Edited: `src/LoggedIn.jsx` (Today route now renders <Today/>),
  `src/TaskRow.jsx` (now imports tasks.css)
- Deleted: `src/Tasks.jsx`
- NOT touched: `db/` (no schema/RLS change), `Categories.jsx`, `Settings.jsx`

HOW TO VERIFY (on your Mac — no SQL):
1. `npm run dev`, open http://localhost:5173, log in. You land on **Today**.
2. You see the masthead, then two columns: **The Day** (a calm placeholder line)
   on the left, and **Today** + **This Week** task blocks on the right with your
   tasks, each showing its dot+tag.
3. In the **Today** block click **+ Add a task**, type a title, Add → it appears
   in Today. Do the same in **This Week** → it appears under This Week. (Confirms
   each lands in the right bucket.)
4. **Tap a task** → the edit panel opens (title, notes, category, priority); set
   a priority and watch the calm kicker appear.
5. **Tick** a task → it strikes through with a filled tick. **Untick** → it
   reopens.
6. **Reload** (Cmd-R) → everything is still there and in the right block.
7. **Settings → Log out**, then log back in → you land on Today, tasks intact and
   only yours.

KNOWN GAPS / RISKS:
- **The left "The Day" column is a Phase-4 placeholder** — no real timeline /
  events yet (decision recorded).
- Built from description, not the actual mock (missing from repo) — spacing/type
  may need a tweak once you compare.
- Someday-bucket tasks aren't shown on this page (intended); there's no UI yet to
  move a task between buckets except by adding it in the right block (bucket-move
  is Piece 2b's other half).

NEXT: Phase 4 — events and the day-column timeline (this fills the left "The Day"
column for real).

FOR THE CHECKER:
- **No schema or RLS change.** `db/` is untouched; Today only reads/writes columns
  that already existed (adds set `time_bucket`; edits/ticks as before). The
  owner-only policies on `tasks` are unchanged.
- **The two blocks split strictly by `time_bucket`** (Today vs This Week); an add
  in a block writes that block's bucket.
- A task still means "Inbox" only by `category_id = null` (adds leave it null;
  the edit panel's Inbox chip writes null) — the Piece-1 rule holds.

### 2026-06-22 — Navigation skeleton — broadsheet masthead + Today/Calendar/Settings nav
WHAT CHANGED (UI/routing only — NO database or schema change):
- **New top app frame** matching the approved "Front Page" mock: the **LifeOS**
  nameplate (Fraunces), an edition line + today's date + the live clock, a
  hairline rule, then a **nav strip — Today / Calendar / Settings** — with the
  active item marked by a **terracotta underline**. Uses existing theme.css
  variables only (no new colours).
- **Three routes** (a simple in-app view switch — no router library, matching the
  single-user app as it is):
  - **Today** → renders the EXISTING task view for now (the real Today layout is
    the next piece — not built yet).
  - **Calendar** → the existing empty week-view shell (desktop) / day view (phone).
  - **Settings** → a NEW page holding the **Categories manager moved here
    unchanged**, plus the **signed-in email** and the **Log out** action.
- **Retired the temporary entry points:** the old masthead Calendar/Categories
  switch and the separate Tasks link are gone — their destinations now live in the
  nav. **Categories is no longer a top-level destination** (it's under Settings).
- **Optional flourishes built in but easy to drop** (your call as art director):
  the "Vol. I · No. 142" edition line, the italic colophon at the foot, and the
  "categories, account" subtitle under Settings. Say the word and I'll remove any.

NOTE: the mock file `mockups/lifeos-today-frontpage.html` was NOT in the repo, so
this was built from your written description + 06-design.md. Match it against your
mock when you have it and I'll adjust.

FILES TOUCHED:
- New: `src/Settings.jsx`, `src/settings.css`
- Edited: `src/Masthead.jsx` (two-tier header + new nav, Log out removed),
  `src/masthead.css`, `src/LoggedIn.jsx` (3 routes + colophon footer),
  `src/calendar.css` (colophon style)
- NOT touched: `src/Categories.jsx` / `src/categories.css` (moved intact), all of
  `db/` (no schema/RLS change).

HOW TO VERIFY (on your Mac — no SQL):
1. `npm run dev`, open http://localhost:5173, log in.
2. You should see the **LifeOS** masthead with the date + live clock, a hairline
   rule, and a **Today / Calendar / Settings** nav. **Today** is active (terracotta
   underline) and shows **your tasks**.
3. Click **Calendar** → the empty week-view shell. The underline moves to Calendar.
4. Click **Settings** → you see **Signed in as <your email>**, a **Log out**
   button, and the **Categories** manager below it.
5. In Settings, **add or find a category** (e.g. type a name, Add) — it works
   exactly as before.
6. Click **Log out** from Settings → you're signed out. Log back in → you land on
   **Today** with your tasks.
7. Confirm there's no longer a separate "Tasks" or "Categories" link up top.

KNOWN GAPS / RISKS:
- **Today is a placeholder** — it shows the existing task list, NOT the real Today
  front-page layout (that's NEXT).
- Built from description, not the actual mock file (missing from repo) — spacing/
  type may need a tweak once you compare to your mock.
- The decorative flourishes are on by default; tell me if you want them off.

NEXT: the Today home layout (the real Front Page — today's tasks + appointments,
the day-column timeline comes with the calendar work).

FOR THE CHECKER:
- **No schema or RLS change.** `db/` is untouched; this is UI/routing only. No
  query changed — Categories/Tasks read-write exactly as before.
- **Categories moved into Settings intact** — `Categories.jsx`/`categories.css`
  were not edited; Settings just renders `<Categories />` under an account band.
- **The three routes each load the right screen:** Today → the task view,
  Calendar → the week/day shell, Settings → Categories + email + Log out.

### 2026-06-22 — Phase 3 (Piece 2a) — Editing a task (title, notes, category, priority)
WHAT CHANGED:
- **Tap a task → an inline edit panel opens** (the same calm expand-on-tap
  pattern as the Categories manager). In it you can edit the **title**, add/edit
  **notes**, **reassign the category** (selectable dot+tag chips reusing the
  `CategoryTag` look, including an "Inbox" option), and set **priority**
  (None / Low / Med / High).
- **Saving is inline, no Save button:** title + notes persist when you click away
  (on blur); category + priority persist the moment you tap. All writes go to
  columns that already existed from Piece 1.
- **Priority now shows in the list, calmly** (see the choice below).
- The tick-to-complete and add-by-title behaviour from Piece 1 are unchanged.
- Split the row into its own `TaskRow.jsx` to keep files small.

PRIORITY-DISPLAY CHOICE (and why — tweak this freely, you're the art director):
- I did NOT use colour for priority. The design doc reserves the terracotta
  accent for today / the now-line / overdue, and keeps warm reds darker than it
  so nothing falsely reads as "urgent". A red "high" flag would fight that.
- Instead, priority reads through **ink and weight**, the broadsheet way:
  - **High:** a small uppercase **"High"** kicker in full-strength ink, and the
    task title nudged to medium weight — the "lead item" feel. It quietly draws
    the eye without shouting.
  - **Med:** a small uppercase **"Med"** kicker in muted grey. Present, but it
    doesn't pull focus.
  - **Low / None:** nothing shown at all — near-invisible, so only what matters
    draws the eye.
  - Priority marks hide on a done task (it's no longer pending).
- If you'd prefer a different mark (a small dot/square, italics, a thin rule, or
  showing Low too), it's a quick change — tell me and I'll tune it, then I'll
  record the locked choice in the decisions doc.

FILES TOUCHED:
- New: `src/TaskRow.jsx`
- Edited: `src/Tasks.jsx` (refactored to use TaskRow + edit handlers),
  `src/tasks.css` (edit panel, chips, priority styles)
- NO database files touched (`db/` unchanged).

HOW TO VERIFY (on your Mac — no SQL this time):
1. `npm run dev`, open http://localhost:5173, log in, click **Tasks**.
2. **Tap a task's title** (not the circle). A panel opens below it.
3. Change the **title**, then click away → the line above updates and it sticks.
4. Type some **notes**, click away (notes are kept; they'll be shown in a later
   piece — for now just confirm they persist, step 7).
5. Under **Category**, tap a different category chip → the dot+tag on the task
   updates immediately. Tap **Inbox** → it goes back to the Inbox tag.
6. Under **Priority**, tap **High** → the title gets a touch bolder and a small
   "High" kicker appears. Tap **Med** → it changes to a muted "Med". Tap
   **None** → the mark disappears.
7. **Reload the page** (Cmd-R). Open the same task again — your title, notes,
   category and priority are all still there.
8. **Log out and back in**, open **Tasks** — everything persisted and it's only
   yours (owner-only).

KNOWN GAPS / RISKS:
- The priority display is intentionally up for your eye (see the choice above) —
  not yet locked in the decisions doc.
- Still bare on purpose: no time-bucket views, no due-date picker, no subtasks UI
  (those columns exist; their UI is Pieces 2b–2d). No per-task delete in the UI
  yet.
- Notes are saved but not shown in the calm list line yet (kept minimal); they
  appear in the edit panel.

NEXT: Phase 3, Piece 2b — time-bucket views (Today / This Week / Someday) and
moving tasks between them.

FOR THE CHECKER:
- **No schema or RLS change.** `db/` is untouched; the edit panel only writes to
  columns that already existed (`title`, `notes`, `category_id`, `priority`).
  The four owner-only policies on `tasks` are exactly as shipped in Piece 1.
- **Nothing touches events or the calendar** — this piece is the tasks list only.
- Category reassignment keeps the Piece-1 rule: a task means "Inbox" by having
  `category_id = null` (the "Inbox" chip writes null), never by pointing at the
  Inbox row's id.

### 2026-06-22 — Phase 3 (Piece 1) — Tasks spine table + bare-bones verify UI
WHAT CHANGED:
- **New `tasks` table in Supabase**, built to the FULL architecture shape so
  later pieces bolt on with no rebuild: title, notes, category, parent task
  (subtasks), priority, time bucket, due date, scheduled start/end, status,
  completed_at, source, created_at. SQL: `db/03_tasks.sql` (run it once — steps
  below). RLS ON, owner-only. ADDS to the spine; does NOT change categories.
- **Category link is "empty on delete" (SET NULL), never cascade** — deleting a
  category drops its tasks into Inbox instead of deleting them. Same for the
  parent-task link (subtasks get promoted, not deleted). Enforced in the DB.
- **Fixed-value fields locked in the DB** (CHECK constraints) for status,
  priority and time_bucket — a bad value can never be stored.
- **`completed_at` kept honest by a DB trigger** — stamped when a task is marked
  done, cleared when reopened, so the "finished at" time can never lie.
- **A calm Tasks view** (reachable from a new "Tasks" link in the masthead):
  lists your tasks, add one by typing a title (lands in Today), optional
  category picker (Inbox by default), and a tick to mark done / reopen. Done
  tasks show a struck title + a quiet "Done · <time>". Reuses the paper/ink/
  Fraunces foundation and the dot+tag (`CategoryTag`).
- This is the VERIFY UI, not the real task manager. No priority controls,
  time-bucket views, due-date picker, subtasks UI, calendar, or activity_log —
  those columns exist but the UI doesn't touch them yet (Piece 2+).

FILES TOUCHED:
- New: `db/03_tasks.sql`, `src/Tasks.jsx`, `src/tasks.css`
- Edited: `src/LoggedIn.jsx` (Tasks view), `src/Masthead.jsx` (Tasks nav link)

SUPABASE STEP (do this once, before verifying):
1. Open the SQL editor:
   https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/sql/new
   (or Dashboard → your project → SQL Editor → New query).
2. Open `db/03_tasks.sql`, copy the WHOLE file, paste it in, click **Run**.
   You should see "Success. No rows returned." (It needs `db/01_categories.sql`
   already run, which it is.)

HOW TO VERIFY (on your Mac):
1. `npm run dev`, open http://localhost:5173, log in.
2. Click **Tasks** in the masthead. You'll see an empty list + an add row.
3. Type a title (e.g. "Buy milk"), leave the picker on **Inbox**, click **Add**.
   It appears with an **Inbox** tag (Slate dot).
4. Add another and pick one of your categories — it shows that category's
   coloured dot + tag.
5. Click the circle to the left of a task → it fills terracotta, the title gets
   struck through, and a **"Done · <date, time>"** stamp appears.
6. Click the filled circle again to reopen → the strike + the Done stamp both
   vanish (the finish time is cleared, so it can never be stale).
7. Go to **Categories**, delete the category you assigned in step 4. Return to
   **Tasks** — that task is **still there**, now back in **Inbox** (NOT gone).
8. Click **Log out**, then log back in, open **Tasks** — your tasks are still
   there. Confirms they persisted and are only yours (owner-only).

KNOWN GAPS / RISKS:
- Bare-bones on purpose: no priority/time-bucket/due-date/subtasks UI yet (the
  schema has the columns; the UI is Piece 2+). No edit/delete of a task in the
  UI yet (that's the real task manager, Piece 2).
- The category picker is a plain dropdown; nesting shows as simple indentation.

NEXT: Phase 3, Piece 2 — the REAL task UI (edit, priority, time buckets, due
dates, and so on).

FOR THE CHECKER (please confirm against `db/03_tasks.sql`):
- The `tasks` table is **owner-only**: RLS is enabled and all four policies
  (select/insert/update/delete) are keyed to `auth.uid() = user_id`; `user_id`
  defaults to `auth.uid()` so an owner can't be forged.
- `category_id` **references `public.categories(id)` with `ON DELETE SET NULL`**
  (NOT cascade) — deleting a category empties its tasks into Inbox, never
  deletes them. (`parent_task_id` self-FK is also SET NULL.)
- The fixed-value fields have **DB CHECK constraints**: `status` (open/done),
  `priority` (high/med/low), `time_bucket` (Today/This Week/Someday).
- `completed_at` is managed by the `tasks_sync_completed_at` trigger (set on
  done, cleared on reopen).
- This change **ADDS** the tasks table and does **NOT** modify the categories
  table or its meaning (no edits to `db/01_categories.sql` /
  `db/02_categories_guards.sql`).

### 2026-06-22 — Phase 2 (Piece 3b) — Category colour palette wired in (PHASE 2 DONE)
WHAT CHANGED:
- **Locked the 16-colour palette** (12 distinct + 4 lighter shades) after you
  signed off on the eye-validation preview. The full set with names + hexes is in
  the decisions doc and `06-design.md`; the editable source is `src/palette.js`.
- **Removed the temporary "Palette" preview tab** (and its files) now that it's
  done its job.
- **Colour on the Categories list:** tap a category → an expanded panel now has a
  **Colour** row of the curated swatches (the set only — no free hex picker).
  Pick one and the row shows the calm **coloured dot + short uppercase tag**.
  There's a "no colour" hollow swatch to clear it again.
- **Inbox** shows **Slate** by default (set once on load). **New categories start
  uncoloured** — a quiet hollow dot — until you pick.
- The dot/tag is a **reusable component** (`CategoryTag`) so the calendar can use
  the exact look later. It is **not** wired into the calendar/tasks/events — the
  Categories view is the only place colour shows for now.
- **No database change** — colour reuses the existing `color` column (it stores
  the colour's name-id like `teal`, not a hex). RLS untouched.

FILES TOUCHED:
- New: `src/palette.js`, `src/CategoryTag.jsx`, `src/categoryTag.css`
- Edited: `src/Categories.jsx`, `src/CategoryRow.jsx`, `src/categories.css`,
  `src/Masthead.jsx`, `src/LoggedIn.jsx`
- Removed: `src/PalettePreview.jsx`, `src/palettePreview.css`

HOW TO VERIFY (on your Mac — no SQL needed this time):
1. `npm run dev`, open http://localhost:5173, log in, click **Categories**.
2. **Inbox** should show a **Slate** dot beside its uppercase tag.
3. Tap one of your categories (e.g. "Uni"). In the expanded panel, under
   **Colour**, click a swatch (say Teal). The row's dot turns that colour and the
   name shows as a small uppercase tag.
4. Click the hollow "no colour" swatch — the dot goes back to an empty outline.
5. Give a couple of categories different colours so you can see them side by side.
6. **Proof it persists & is only yours:** **Log out**, log back in, open
   Categories — your colours are exactly as you left them.

KNOWN GAPS / RISKS:
- Colour shows on the Categories view only — the calendar/tasks don't use it yet
  (Phases 3–4), though `CategoryTag` is ready for them.
- Dark-mode colours aren't built — the palette is structured for them, but there's
  no dark mode to validate against yet.
- No drag-to-reorder; ordering is still by creation.
- Local preview only this session (not redeployed).

NEXT: **Phase 3 — Tasks.** Add/edit/complete/prioritise tasks, time-buckets,
subtasks, due dates — tasks reference a category. This is the next real spine
table; same rules (RLS owner-only, ADD to the spine, don't change core meaning).

FOR THE CHECKER: Confirm there was **no schema or policy change** — colour is just
the existing `categories.color` text column (now holding a palette id like
`'teal'`), and **RLS is untouched** (still the four owner-only `auth.uid() =
user_id` policies from Pieces 2/3a). Confirm nothing touches tasks/events/the
calendar, and that the colour set is the curated list (no free hex input).

### 2026-06-22 — Phase 2 (Piece 3a) — Real category manager: rename, nest, delete
WHAT CHANGED:
- The Categories page is now a real manager. Buckets show as an **indented tree**.
  **Tap a row** to expand calm inline actions: **rename** it, **move it inside**
  another bucket (nesting), **add a sub-category**, or **delete** it.
- **Delete reparents children up one level** — delete a middle bucket and its
  sub-buckets move up to its parent; delete a top-level bucket and its children
  become top-level. Nothing is lost (your chosen rule).
- **Duplicate names are blocked under the same parent** (case-insensitive);
  different parents may reuse a name. You'll see a plain message if it clashes.
- **Inbox is protected in the database**: it can't be deleted, renamed, or
  nested — not just hidden in the UI. It shows as a "default bucket", no actions.
- **Cycles are blocked**: you can't move a category inside itself or one of its
  own sub-categories (the move list hides those; the database refuses it too).
- The decision back-and-forth (delete→reparent-up; duplicates→block per parent)
  is recorded in the decisions doc.

FILES TOUCHED:
- New: `db/02_categories_guards.sql` (the DB rules/triggers), `src/CategoryRow.jsx`,
  `src/categoryTree.js`
- Edited: `src/Categories.jsx` (now the manager), `src/categories.css` (tree +
  panel styles)

SUPABASE / SQL STEPS (do this once, on your Mac, BEFORE testing):
1. Open the SQL editor:
   https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/cntlptuacsujbdtwvbis/sql/new
2. Open `db/02_categories_guards.sql`, copy ALL of it, paste, click **Run**.
   Expect "Success. No rows returned."
   (If it errors on the unique index, you already have two categories with the
   same name under the same parent — delete one in the Table editor and re-run.)

HOW TO VERIFY (in the app, on your Mac):
1. `npm run dev`, open http://localhost:5173, log in, click **Categories**.
2. **Add some nesting:** add a top-level "Uni" (box at the bottom). Tap **Uni**,
   use "Add a sub-category" to add "Q2". Tap **Q2**, add "Class A". You should
   see Uni → Q2 → Class A stepping in with indentation.
3. **Rename:** tap "Class A", change the name box, click **Rename** — the row
   updates.
4. **Move (nest an existing one):** add a top-level "Reading", tap it, and in the
   "Inside" dropdown pick "Uni" — it slides under Uni.
5. **Inbox can't be deleted:** Inbox shows "default bucket" with no Delete button.
   It's also blocked in the database (a UI bypass would still be refused).
6. **No cycles:** tap "Uni", open the "Inside" dropdown — notice Q2 and Class A
   (its own descendants) are NOT offered, so you can't nest Uni inside itself.
7. **Delete a normal category and watch the children move up:** tap **Q2** and
   click **Delete**. Q2 disappears and **Class A moves up under Uni** (it wasn't
   deleted with it).
8. **Duplicate guard:** try adding a second top-level "Uni" — you'll get
   "A category with that name already exists here." (But "Uni" under a different
   parent is allowed.)
9. **Proof it's saved & only yours:** **Log out**, log back in, open Categories —
   your tree is exactly as you left it (RLS returns only your rows).

KNOWN GAPS / RISKS:
- You must run `db/02_categories_guards.sql` once first, or the new rules aren't
  active (deletes would cascade-delete children instead of reparenting them).
- No colour anything yet — that's Piece 3b. No drag-to-reorder; ordering is by
  creation for now. Renaming the Inbox is intentionally not allowed.
- Rare edge: deleting a category whose child would collide with a same-named
  bucket at the destination is refused (duplicate rule) — move/rename first.
- Local preview only this session (not deployed). The DB rules live in Supabase
  once you run the SQL, so deploy needs nothing extra.

NEXT: **Phase 2, Piece 3b** — the 16-colour curated palette + the dot/uppercase-
tag look, done with the owner as art director. Do NOT start until 3a is verified.

FOR THE CHECKER: Confirm **RLS is still owner-only** after the new update/delete
paths (the triggers add rules, they don't change the four `auth.uid() = user_id`
policies, and run as the invoker so they can't touch other owners' rows). Confirm
**Inbox is undeletable AND unrenamable/un-nestable at the DB level** (the
`before delete` / `before write` triggers in `db/02_categories_guards.sql`), not
just hidden in the UI. Confirm **cycles cannot be created** (trigger walks
ancestors and rejects; UI also hides descendants) and that a **parent must belong
to the same owner**. Confirm this is still spine-only: no task/event tables
touched, no colour/palette work, `color` column still unused.

### 2026-06-22 — Phase 2 (Piece 2 of 3) — Categories table + bare-bones view
WHAT CHANGED:
- Created the **categories** table — the first real spine table. It holds your
  buckets, can nest later (a `parent_id` self-link), has an empty `color` column
  for the Piece-3 palette, a `sort_order`, and a `created_at`. Row-level security
  is ON and owner-only: the database only ever returns or accepts rows belonging
  to the logged-in owner (read/add/change/delete all locked to your account).
- **Inbox** is seeded as the default first bucket — a normal category row, not
  special machinery. The seed is idempotent (won't make a second Inbox).
- Built a plain **Categories view**: lists your buckets (Inbox shows up) and lets
  you add one by typing a name. No colours, no nesting, no edit/delete yet — on
  purpose. It reuses the Piece-1 paper/ink/fonts so it fits in.
- Added a small **Calendar / Categories** switch in the masthead to open it
  (temporary placement — we'll give it a proper home later).

FILES TOUCHED:
- New: `db/01_categories.sql` (the table + RLS + Inbox seed),
  `src/Categories.jsx`, `src/categories.css`
- Edited: `src/Masthead.jsx`, `src/masthead.css` (the view switch),
  `src/LoggedIn.jsx` (calendar ↔ categories)

SUPABASE / SQL STEPS (do this once, on your Mac):
1. Open the Supabase SQL editor:
   https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/cntlptuacsujbdtwvbis/sql/new
2. Open `db/01_categories.sql` from the project, copy ALL of it, paste into the
   editor, and click **Run**. You should see "Success. No rows returned."
3. (Optional sanity check) In the dashboard → Table editor → `categories`, you
   should see one row named **Inbox**.

HOW TO VERIFY (in the app, on your Mac):
1. In Terminal, from the lifeos folder: `npm run dev`, then open
   http://localhost:5173 and log in.
2. In the top strip, click **Categories**. You should see a calm page titled
   "Categories" with **Inbox** listed, and a box to add one.
3. Type a name (e.g. "Uni") and click **Add** — it should appear in the list
   immediately, under Inbox.
4. Click **Calendar** then **Categories** again — your new category is still
   there (it saved to the database).
5. **Prove it's only yours / really saved:** click **Log out**, then log back in,
   open **Categories** — Inbox and "Uni" should still be there. (RLS means the
   database only ever hands back your own rows.)

KNOWN GAPS / RISKS:
- You must run the SQL once before the view works; until then, opening
  Categories will show a red error message (the table doesn't exist yet).
- Bare-bones on purpose: no colour, no sub-categories, no editing/renaming or
  deleting yet. Adding the same name twice is currently allowed.
- Not deployed to Vercel this session (local preview only). When we deploy, the
  table already lives in Supabase, so nothing extra is needed there.

NEXT: **Phase 2, Piece 3** — the 16-colour curated category palette (needs your
eye-validation), then later the nesting UI and edit/delete. Do NOT start Piece 3
until you've verified this one.

FOR THE CHECKER: Confirm the `categories` table is **owner-only via RLS** — all
four policies key on `auth.uid() = user_id`, and `user_id` defaults to
`auth.uid()` so a client can't insert rows for anyone else. Confirm an **Inbox**
default exists (seeded as a normal row, idempotent — not special machinery).
Confirm this **adds to the spine without changing core meaning**: it only adds
the `categories` table per the architecture doc (nullable `parent_id`/`color`
present but unused in UI), and touches no task/event tables. Confirm no colour
palette, nesting UI, or edit/delete was built (those are later pieces).

### 2026-06-22 — Phase 2 (Piece 1 of 3) — Shared visual foundation (NOT locked)
WHAT CHANGED:
- Loaded two fonts: **Fraunces** (the serif, for the masthead + headlines) and
  **Inter** (the sans, for body, UI and all numbers), regular + medium only,
  straight from Google Fonts in `index.html`. Numbers use Inter's tabular
  figures so they line up and the clock doesn't jitter.
- Added one small **theme file** (`src/theme.css`) holding every colour and
  font as variables, so the whole look is tweakable from one place. Starting
  colours (warm, all yours to change): paper `#F4EFE4`, ink `#1C1916`, muted
  grey `#5C564C`, hairline `#D8D0BE`, terracotta accent `#C8643D`. A dark-mode
  block is pre-written and commented out for later.
- Built one **masthead** strip across the top: the "LifeOS" nameplate in
  Fraunces, today's date, a live ticking clock, and a thin hairline beneath.
  Moved the **Log out** button into it, so there's now a single top bar (the
  old duplicate one is gone). Left a gap where weather will slot in later — no
  weather is shown (we have no source yet).
- Made the **login screen** and the **calendar** inherit the new fonts and
  paper/ink automatically. Removed the calendar's own duplicate "LifeOS" text
  (the masthead provides it now). The calendar's grid/layout is unchanged — it
  just picked up the warm colours and the terracotta now-line/today marker.

FILES TOUCHED: index.html, src/main.jsx, src/theme.css (new),
src/masthead.css (new), src/Masthead.jsx (new), src/dateUtils.js,
src/LoggedIn.jsx, src/App.jsx, src/Login.jsx, src/calendar.css

HOW TO VERIFY (on your Mac):
1. In Terminal, from the lifeos folder, run:  `npm run dev`
2. Open  http://localhost:5173 .
3. **Login screen** (if logged out): "LifeOS" should now be in the Fraunces
   serif, on a warm off-white (not white) background, with a near-black
   button. (If you're already logged in, click Log out to see it.)
4. **Calendar** (after logging in): up top, a single thin strip — "LifeOS" in
   serif on the left, today's date in small uppercase letters, and a clock
   ticking every second beside it (the digits should NOT jiggle as seconds
   change), with Log out on the right and a hairline rule under the whole
   strip. The grid below should look the same shape as before but warmer: off-
   white paper, terracotta "now" line and today circle, hour labels lined up.
5. Make the window narrow (under ~768px) — the masthead stays one strip and the
   single-day phone view shows, both in the new colours.

KNOWN GAPS / RISKS:
- **Not locked.** These are starting fonts/colours — the owner wants to eyeball
  and tweak before we commit to them. Do not treat the palette as final.
- Fonts load from Google's servers; on a cold load there can be a brief moment
  before Fraunces/Inter swap in (text shows in a fallback first, no blank flash).
- Visual only — still no categories, Inbox, colour palette, tasks or events.
- Not deployed to Vercel yet (local preview only this session).

NEXT: **Phase 2, Piece 2** — categories (the buckets) with their own table and
the Inbox as default. (First piece that adds a real table: RLS on, owner-only,
adds to the spine without changing the task/event/category core meaning.) Do
NOT start it until the owner has signed off on Piece 1's look.

FOR THE CHECKER: This is visual-only — confirm no database tables, categories,
Inbox or category-colour palette were added (those are Pieces 2 & 3). Confirm
all colours/fonts come from the one theme file (`src/theme.css`) via CSS
variables, that there's a single top bar (no stacked headers), and that the
calendar grid's layout is unchanged from the prior shell (only colours/type
differ). Note the type/accent now depart from the design doc's old working
faces — that was the owner's art-director call, recorded in the decisions doc.

### 2026-06-22 — Phase 1 — DEPLOYED & VERIFIED (phase complete)
WHAT CHANGED:
- Pushed the calendar-shell commit to GitHub (it had been committed locally but
  not pushed, so Vercel hadn't built it).
- Diagnosed the blank live site: Vercel was missing the two Supabase env vars
  because `.env` is gitignored and never reaches GitHub. Added `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`
  and `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` in the Vercel dashboard, then redeployed.
- Owner verified end-to-end: logged in successfully on BOTH Mac and iPhone against
  the LIVE Vercel site, and the empty week-view calendar renders on both. This
  meets Phase 1's "done when" (open the app on my phone and log in). Phase 1 is
  done; Phase 2 (Categories & Inbox) is now the current phase.
- No code changed this session — this was deploy + verify only. Brain docs updated.

FILES TOUCHED: 02-roadmap.md, 03-decisions.md, 04-handoff-log.md
(no app source changed; the env vars live in the Vercel dashboard, not the repo)

HOW TO VERIFY:
1. On your iPhone, open the live Vercel URL, log in via the email magic link —
   you should land on the empty single-day calendar view.
2. On your Mac, open the same live Vercel URL (not localhost), log in — you should
   see the full week grid. Both already confirmed working by the owner.
3. Run `git log --oneline -1` in the lifeos folder and confirm the latest commit
   is this session's brain-doc update, and `git status` shows nothing to push.

KNOWN GAPS / RISKS:
- The two Vercel env vars are a manual, off-GitHub step. If the Supabase keys ever
  change, or a new deploy target is added, they must be re-entered in the Vercel
  dashboard and the app redeployed (Vercel bakes them in at build time).
- Still a visual-only shell — no categories, tasks, or events exist yet.
- New-user signups remain open by default (noted in step-1 entry); fine for now
  under single-user + RLS, lock down later.

NEXT: Phase 2 — Categories & Inbox. Create/edit buckets with colors and
sub-levels, with Inbox as the default bucket. (Done when my real-life categories
exist.) This is the first phase that ADDS a real table — keep RLS on and do not
touch the core task/event meaning.

FOR THE CHECKER: Nothing to review in code this session (deploy + verify only).
Going into Phase 2, please sanity-check the plan before building: confirm the new
categories table is owner-only via RLS, has an Inbox default, and ADDS to the
spine without changing the task/event/category core meaning per CLAUDE.md.

### 2026-06-22 — Phase 1 (step 2) — Empty week-view calendar shell
WHAT CHANGED:
- After login, the old "you're logged in" placeholder is gone — you now land on
  the calendar. The Log out button moved into a top bar (always reachable).
- Desktop: an empty Apple-Calendar-style WEEK view — 7 columns (Mon–Sun) with
  hour rows down the left, the current week's date range in the top bar, today's
  column subtly tinted with a red date circle, and a live red "now" line. It
  scrolls and opens around 7am. No events — it's purely the visual shell.
- Phone (narrow screens): instead of a squished 7-column grid, a clean single
  DAY view for today — big date header, "Nothing scheduled yet", and the same
  tidy hour list with the red now-line.
- No data, no database, no task/event/category tables touched.

FILES TOUCHED: src/App.jsx, src/LoggedIn.jsx (rewritten as the app frame),
src/WeekCalendar.jsx (new), src/DayAgenda.jsx (new), src/NowLine.jsx (new),
src/dateUtils.js (new), src/calendar.css (new)

HOW TO VERIFY:
Desktop (on your Mac):
1. In Terminal, from the lifeos folder, run:  npm run dev
2. Open  http://localhost:5173  and log in (email magic link, as before).
3. You should see a full-screen week grid: a top bar reading "LifeOS",
   the week's date range (e.g. "Jun 22–28, 2026"), and a "Log out" button.
   Below: 7 day columns with hour labels down the side. Today's column is
   faintly tinted, today's date sits in a red circle, and a thin red line
   marks the current time. Scroll up/down through the hours. The grid is empty.
4. Click "Log out" — you should return to the login screen.
Phone (do this after we deploy, OR on your Mac to preview the layout):
- Make the browser window very narrow (under ~768px wide) — the week grid
  should switch to a single clean day view for today with a big date header.

KNOWN GAPS / RISKS:
- This is a visual shell only — nothing can be added to it yet (that's Phase 3+).
- Not deployed to Vercel yet, so the phone test is best done after deploy.
- Tailwind (named in the architecture doc) is still not used; we styled with a
  small plain CSS file instead — see the new entry in the decisions doc.

NEXT: Deploy this to Vercel (the same two env vars are already set there from
step 1; just push and let it build), then open it on your phone and log in —
that completes Phase 1's "done when".

FOR THE CHECKER: Confirm no task/event/category tables or data were added (this
should be visual-only), that the desktop week view and phone day view both render
from the same data-free components, and that no Supabase keys are hard-coded.

### 2026-06-21 — Phase 1 (step 1) — Supabase connection + email magic-link login
WHAT CHANGED:
- Installed the official Supabase library and connected the app to Supabase
  using environment variables (no keys in the code; real keys live in a local
  .env that is gitignored and NOT committed).
- Built an email magic-link login: type your email → get a login link → tap it
  → you're back in the app logged in. Logged-in view shows "You're logged in as
  <email>" and a Log out button. (No calendar yet — that's the next step.)

FILES TOUCHED: package.json, package-lock.json, .gitignore, .env.example,
index.html, src/supabaseClient.js, src/Login.jsx, src/LoggedIn.jsx, src/App.jsx
(plus a local .env holding the real keys — gitignored, never committed)

HOW TO VERIFY (do this on your Mac before we deploy):
1. In the Supabase dashboard → Authentication → URL Configuration:
   set Site URL to  http://localhost:5173  and add Redirect URL
   http://localhost:5173/**  — then Save.
   Direct link: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/cntlptuacsujbdtwvbis/auth/url-configuration
2. In Terminal, from the lifeos folder, run:  npm run dev
3. Open  http://localhost:5173 , type your email, click "Send me a login link".
4. Check your inbox, tap the link — you should land back on the app showing
   "You're logged in as <your email>" and a Log out button.
5. Click Log out — you should return to the login screen.

KNOWN GAPS / RISKS:
- I confirmed it BUILDS cleanly, but I can't complete the email round-trip myself
  (I can't read your inbox). Your local test above is the real confirmation.
- Step 1 (the dashboard redirect URL) is required or the link won't return you to
  the app — easy to forget.
- Supabase's built-in email sender has a low hourly limit; if links stop arriving
  during repeated testing, wait a while or check spam.
- New-user signups are allowed by default. Single-user + RLS makes this fine for
  now; we can lock signups down later.

NEXT: Phase 1 (step 2) — empty week-view calendar on desktop + a stripped phone
layout. After that we deploy to Vercel (adding the same two env vars there and the
Vercel URL to Supabase redirect URLs) and you log in on your phone.

FOR THE CHECKER: Confirm NO .env file is committed (only .env.example, which holds
placeholders), and that no Supabase URL or key is hard-coded in any source file
(they must come only from import.meta.env via .env).

### 2026-06-21 — Phase 0 — Setup complete, empty app live
WHAT CHANGED:
- Created all five free accounts: GitHub (chrisolmosvv), Supabase, Vercel,
  Telegram bot, Google AI Studio (Gemini).
- Initialized the git repo, added all seven brain docs, and pushed to GitHub.
- Built a minimal React+Vite app (one page: "LifeOS" centered on screen),
  confirmed it builds cleanly, committed, pushed, and deployed live on Vercel.

FILES TOUCHED: 00-overview.md, 01-architecture.md, 02-roadmap.md, 03-decisions.md,
CLAUDE.md, 04-handoff-log.md, 05-glossary.md, index.html, vite.config.js,
package.json, package-lock.json, src/main.jsx, src/App.jsx, .gitignore

HOW TO VERIFY:
- Repo on GitHub: https://github.com/chrisolmosvv/lifeos — should show all files.
- Live app on Vercel: open the Vercel dashboard, find the lifeos project, click
  the deployment URL — you should see a white page with "LifeOS" in the center.
- Run `git log --oneline` in the lifeos folder — should show 3 commits.

KNOWN GAPS / RISKS:
- Claude Code login showed "Claude Pro" in the UI during setup — worth confirming
  it is actually running on the Max plan (Pro won't have enough capacity for long
  build sessions).
- Vercel deployment was done manually in the browser; not yet connected to
  auto-deploy on git push (Vercel usually sets this up automatically — confirm
  it's active in the Vercel dashboard).

NEXT: Phase 1 — build the real app shell: Supabase login (magic link or Google),
empty week-view calendar visible on desktop, stripped layout on phone.

FOR THE CHECKER: Confirm the live Vercel URL loads correctly and the GitHub repo
contains only the brain docs + app source (no node_modules, no .env files).
