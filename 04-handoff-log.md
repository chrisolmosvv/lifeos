# LifeOS — Handoff Log

> I am the message that lets the chats and Claude Code talk through you.
> LIVING doc. Newest entry on top. Keep entries short.

## How the relay works
You (the owner) are the messenger. Nobody reads this automatically except
Claude Code. To coordinate:

1. **Planner chat → Builder.** You discuss a phase in a chat here; it gives you
   a clear instruction. You paste that into Claude Code.
2. **Builder writes an entry here** describing what it did and how to verify.
3. **Builder → Checker chat.** You paste the latest entry (plus screenshots or
   the file it names) into a fresh "checker" chat here. Ask it to review.
4. **Checker → Builder.** The checker writes a short "fix list." You paste that
   back into Claude Code.

Tip: to give a chat here the current code, either paste the file, upload it, or
(if your GitHub repo is public) paste the raw file link and ask the chat to read it.

## Log

### 2026-06-21 — Phase 0 — Setup complete, empty app live
WHAT CHANGED:
- Created all five free accounts: GitHub (chrisolmosvv), Supabase, Vercel,
  Telegram bot, Google AI Studio (Gemini).
- Initialized the git repo, added all seven brain docs, and pushed to GitHub.
- Built a minimal React+Vite app (one page: "LifeOS" centered on screen),
  confirmed it builds cleanly, committed, pushed, and deployed live on Vercel.

FILES TOUCHED: 00-overview.md, 01-architecture.md, 02-roadmap.md, 03-decisions.md,
CLAUDE.md, 04-handoff-log.md, 05-glossary.md, index.html, vite.config.js,
package.json, package-lock.json, src/main.jsx, src/App.jsx, .gitignore

HOW TO VERIFY:
- Repo on GitHub: https://github.com/chrisolmosvv/lifeos — should show all files.
- Live app on Vercel: open the Vercel dashboard, find the lifeos project, click
  the deployment URL — you should see a white page with "LifeOS" in the center.
- Run `git log --oneline` in the lifeos folder — should show 3 commits.

KNOWN GAPS / RISKS:
- Claude Code login showed "Claude Pro" in the UI during setup — worth confirming
  it is actually running on the Max plan (Pro won't have enough capacity for long
  build sessions).
- Vercel deployment was done manually in the browser; not yet connected to
  auto-deploy on git push (Vercel usually sets this up automatically — confirm
  it's active in the Vercel dashboard).

NEXT: Phase 1 — build the real app shell: Supabase login (magic link or Google),
empty week-view calendar visible on desktop, stripped layout on phone.

FOR THE CHECKER: Confirm the live Vercel URL loads correctly and the GitHub repo
contains only the brain docs + app source (no node_modules, no .env files).
